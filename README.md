# DeployTest
Testing

Collection problem:
For testing reason, We dont use the 'restaurant' collection. In our work, the create function will auto generate a collection in your mongodb call 'rests'. 
If you need some data to test, Please create a demo or make sure you have a collection call 'rests' in mongodb before you testing our work. 


Since We dont have create the path of '/'. So the default url should be below:


ec2-18-224-22-227.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/login (For the login page)


Here are the path name for you. 

/read

The main page show out the restaurant list.


/create


Used to insert a new restaurant documents.


/register


A secret page for you to testing the register function. We dont have the button to get in that page since the function is not necessary.
